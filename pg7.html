<h1>Savior</h1>


<p> *Opens eyes* </p>

<p> *Sobbing* "I damn near lost my life.. I damn near lost it all stooping to my vices" OH lord, please help me, guide me, show me, a sign or anything!""</p>

<p>"It shouldn't have to be like this, i shouldn't have to get to this point to cherish my life and all the things that i took for granted." </p>

<p>" I admit i have been selfish, miserable and at times hard-headed, but there are things that i do cherish in this world and i know that there is people that feel the same"</p>

<p> "Im going to take the first step in changing my life today, no more drinking after work, no more drugs, no more of anything that can have me ed up in this predicament again"</p>
